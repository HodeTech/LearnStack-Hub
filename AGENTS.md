# Working in this repository — agent guidance

**This file is a redirect.** The single source of truth for project guidance, hard rules, conventions, and documentation layout is [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Read that file first; everything in it applies to **every** AI agent operating on this repository, not only to Claude Code.

`AGENTS.md` exists because some agent runtimes (notably OpenAI Codex and tools that follow the `AGENTS.md` convention) look for that filename specifically before falling back to `CLAUDE.md`. The repository keeps both filenames so neither runtime is left without a guide.

## Differences from CLAUDE.md

There are no rule differences. The only thing that varies between agent runtimes is the **`Co-Authored-By` commit trailer**, which names the assistant that contributed:

- Claude Code sessions:
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- OpenAI Codex sessions:
  `Co-Authored-By: Codex Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`

If multiple agents contributed materially to the same commit, include one trailer per agent. The full trailer convention lives in [learnstack/docs/standards/14-git-workflow.md § Trailers](../learnstack/docs/standards/14-git-workflow.md#trailers).

## Skills

Hub repo does not maintain its own skill catalogue. Both Claude Code and Codex consume the catalogue declared in the sibling LearnStack repo at [`learnstack/.claude/skills/`](../learnstack/.claude/skills/). The same entry-point selection rules (use `implement-task` for substantive work, `start-task` for scoping, `standards-check` + `code-review` for review) apply here.

## Maintaining this file

Do **not** copy CLAUDE.md content into AGENTS.md. If a guidance rule needs to change, change CLAUDE.md; the rule applies everywhere by virtue of the redirect above.
